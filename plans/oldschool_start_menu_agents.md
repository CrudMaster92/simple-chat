# Old-School Start Menu Agent Plan

## Snapshot of Existing Landscape
- Dashboard currently features imaginative, futuristic experiences such as Tidal Dream Cartographer, Chromatic Spice Sketchpad, Zephyr Relay Pen Pals, Glimmer Fossil Cabinet, and Chrono Lantern Workshop.
- None of the registered applets emulate classic operating-system utilities like calculators or memo pads, leaving nostalgic productivity niches open.

## Plan for Five Independent Agents
1. **RetroCalc Console** – Recreate a chunky beige calculator with big membrane buttons, LED-style readouts, and memory registers. Keep interactions delightfully tactile while offering quick-access hotkeys.
2. **Neon Scribbler Notebook** (OpenAI-enabled) – Channel classic WordPad energy with tabbed documents, retro rulers, and a "GenAI Ghostwriter" ribbon button that uses the OpenAI API to suggest prose, summaries, or rewrites.
3. **PixelPalette Paintbox** – Deliver a MS Paint-inspired canvas featuring pixel brushes, spray cans, and shape stamps with a CRT flicker overlay and floppy-disk save metaphors.
4. **FileWave Navigator** – Build a faux file manager with tree-pane navigation, chunky folder icons, and simulated file operations like copy queues and defrag progress bars.
5. **ChimeTrack Scheduler** – Evoke vintage calendar/reminder software with monthly grids, chime selectors, and animated reminder pop-ups styled like dialog balloons.

Each agent should study the existing guidelines, work in isolation, scaffold a new applet directory, and only touch shared registry files when registering their app.

## Prompts for the Five Agents

**Agent 1 – RetroCalc Console**
```
Review the AGENTS.md file in the repository root along with dashboard/agents.md to learn the constraints. Explore the existing applets so you avoid duplicating ideas. Your guiding theme: "RetroCalc Console – a chunky desktop calculator with LED digits, membrane keys, and quick memory registers." Create it as a new applet. Embrace big tactile buttons, keyboard shortcuts, and retro sound ticks. Add your description to the dashboard agents file. Aside from creating your new applet and registering it, do not modify other files.
```

**Agent 2 – Neon Scribbler Notebook (OpenAI-enabled)**
```
Review the AGENTS.md file in the repository root along with dashboard/agents.md to learn the constraints. Explore existing applets so you avoid duplicating ideas. Your guiding theme: "Neon Scribbler Notebook – a WordPad-style editor with a GenAI Ghostwriter ribbon button powered by the OpenAI API for rewrite and brainstorming assistance." Create it as a new applet. Keep the UI retro with tabbed documents, rulers, and neon accent lighting, and wire the Ghostwriter button to call the OpenAI API. Add your description to the dashboard agents file. Aside from creating your new applet and registering it, do not modify other files.
```

**Agent 3 – PixelPalette Paintbox**
```
Review the AGENTS.md file in the repository root along with dashboard/agents.md to learn the constraints. Explore the existing applets so you avoid duplicating ideas. Your guiding theme: "PixelPalette Paintbox – a MS Paint-inspired canvas with pixel brushes, spray cans, and CRT flicker polish." Create it as a new applet. Focus on responsive canvas tools, palette swaps, and fun retro skeuomorphism. Add your description to the dashboard agents file. Aside from creating your new applet and registering it, do not modify other files.
```

**Agent 4 – FileWave Navigator**
```
Review the AGENTS.md file in the repository root along with dashboard/agents.md to learn the constraints. Explore the existing applets so you avoid duplicating ideas. Your guiding theme: "FileWave Navigator – a faux file manager with tree navigation, chunky folder icons, and simulated copy/defrag flows." Create it as a new applet. Highlight directory panes, queue animations, and floppy-disk metaphors. Add your description to the dashboard agents file. Aside from creating your new applet and registering it, do not modify other files.
```

**Agent 5 – ChimeTrack Scheduler**
```
Review the AGENTS.md file in the repository root along with dashboard/agents.md to learn the constraints. Explore the existing applets so you avoid duplicating ideas. Your guiding theme: "ChimeTrack Scheduler – a vintage calendar/reminder suite with dialog-style pop-ups and chime selectors." Create it as a new applet. Encourage playful reminder animations and customizable alert sounds. Add your description to the dashboard agents file. Aside from creating your new applet and registering it, do not modify other files.
```

## Testing
- Not run (planning-only task).
