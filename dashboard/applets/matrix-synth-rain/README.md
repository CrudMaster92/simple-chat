# Matrix Synth Rain

Matrix Synth Rain is a live-coded skyline of glyphs inspired by classic matrix rain, but reimagined as an ambient instrument. Sculpt the stream with palettes, glyph dialects, density, and glow while triggering bursts and ripples in real time.

## Features

- **Palette conductor** – Swap between four neon themes spanning classic emerald to ember amber, each animating gradients and glow.
- **Glyph dialects** – Flow katakana, binary, alphanumeric, or whimsical emoji glyphs.
- **Flow sculpting** – Tune density, drop speed, and trail persistence for precise atmospherics.
- **Luminosity controls** – Dial in shadow glow and toggle a gradient backdrop haze.
- **Performance tricks** – Pause/resume the cascade, trigger pulse bursts, and click to spawn resonance ripples.
- **Responsive canvas** – Retina-aware canvas adapts to resizing and pointer pressure.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Use the control panel to orchestrate the ambiance. The "Pulse Burst" button temporarily intensifies the stream, and clicking on the rain drops a glowing ripple.
