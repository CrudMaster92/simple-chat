# Everseam World Forge

A canvas-based procedural world generator that layers elevation, moisture, and thermal noise into living continents. Adjust the sliders to tune the terrain, toggle contour lines and rivers, and animate shifting climate bands.

## Controls
- **Seed** – Enter or randomize a specific world blueprint.
- **Elevation scale** – Stretch continental plates for broader or tighter landmasses.
- **Terrain detail** – Increase octave depth for more fractal structure.
- **Moisture drift** – Bias the rainfall noise to favour lush or arid regions.
- **Thermal sway** – Warp temperature gradients for polar or tropical dominance.
- **Layer toggles** – Reveal contour highlights, river routes, and a climate pulse overlay.

Hover the map to inspect exact biome, elevation, moisture, and temperature values for any tile.
