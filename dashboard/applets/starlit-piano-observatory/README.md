# Starlit Piano Observatory

Compose shimmering constellations with a compact digital piano. Each note you play launches a glowing star, draws orbiting trails, and logs poetic observations in the Orbit Console. Capture a constellation in real time, then replay it to hear and watch the same pattern sparkle again.

- **Orbit replay:** Resummon your captured motif with a single button and watch the exact starfield bloom again.
