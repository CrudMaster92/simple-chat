# Tidal Dream Cartographer

Tidal Dream Cartographer lets you sketch luminous tide charts for fantastical archipelagos and then invite the OpenAI API to narrate their lore. Tune the tide emotion, archipelago layout, and luminescence, watch the glowing canvas redraw, and finish by weaving GPT-powered prose to accompany each chart.

## Usage
1. Provide your OpenAI API key and preferred model (defaults to `gpt-4o-mini`).
2. Adjust the controls to sculpt a new glowing archipelago map.
3. Click **Weave Tidal Dream** to redraw the map and fetch lore.
4. Read the returned dispatchâ€”two or three paragraphs ending in a single omen sentence.

API keys are used only by your browser; the app makes requests directly to OpenAI.
