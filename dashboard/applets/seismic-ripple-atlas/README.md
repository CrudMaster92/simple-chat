# Seismic Ripple Atlas

Seismic Ripple Atlas listens to the live USGS daily earthquake feed and paints each tremor as an animated ripple.
Magnitude determines the band width, depth influences the glow, and story cards capture the freshest details with
links back to the USGS event pages.

## Data Source
