# Harbor Ember Gambit

A dockside dueling card game where ember-lit suits twist every wave. Choose one of three cards each hand, face the harbor rival, and leverage suit bonuses to reach seven pennants first.

## How to Play
- Each round both players draw three cards from a shared deck of 48 cards.
- Select a card to commit to the wave. The rival secretly chooses one as well.
- Suit effects modify the printed value:
  - **Tideglass**: +1 strength from the steady current.
  - **Emberwake**: Cards 8–12 gather +2 spark.
  - **Galeweave**: Cards 1–5 gain a tailwind worth +3.
  - **Stonebound**: Breaks ties in its favor.
- Highest modified value claims the pennant. First to seven pennants, or the leader when the deck empties, wins.

Use the "Next Hand" button after a wave resolves, and "Restart Voyage" to begin a fresh match.
