# Policy Pioneer Lab

Policy Pioneer Lab is an interactive reinforcement learning playground. Guide a scout drone across a dynamic field, tune learning parameters, and watch a Q-learning policy crystalize in real time.

## Features
- Adjustable learning rate, discount factor, and exploration policy.
- Step-by-step or multi-episode training that animates the agent's path.
- Live Q-table and reward trace visualizations to show how the policy matures.
- Ambient field events like shifting hazards and bonus caches to keep runs fresh.

## How to Use
1. Set your preferred hyperparameters in the control panel.
2. Run single episodes or train in multi-episode bursts.
3. Watch the grid to follow the scout's route and observe policy arrows.
4. Use the history panel to review reward totals and policy confidence.
5. Reset the simulation at any time to experiment with new ideas.

Enjoy exploring the feedback loops that power reinforcement learning!
