# Orbital Mneme Spindle

Orbital Mneme Spindle is a kinetic memory loom that lets you mint narrative
"shards" around a rotating halo. Each ring button forges a distinct flavour of
recollection, combining tone, setting, and texture into a vivid snippet. Drag
the cards to reposition them, adjust the orbit radius, and tune the ambient
drift speed while the ledger keeps a chronological log that can be copied to
your clipboard.

## Controls

- **Ring Buttons** – Mint a new shard with the selected motif and pin it along
the halo.
- **Orbit Spread Slider** – Alters the radius for every shard, widening or
tightening the memory field.
- **Drift Pulse Slider** – Adjusts the perpetual rotation speed, letting the
halo spin faster or even reverse direction.
- **Filament Ledger** – Click any entry to refocus the core readout or copy the
entire log as a constellation summary.

The palette blends deep ink (#0b1514), charcoal green (#102421), pale mist
(#d9e4dd), amber sunspot (#ffd166), ember orange (#ff7a48), and chalky glow
(#f0f6b2).
