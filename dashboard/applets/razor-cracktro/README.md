# Razor Cracktro Applet

This applet recreates the look and feel of a classic "cracktro"—a short audiovisual intro that software cracking groups released in the 1980s and 1990s. The dashboard module showcases animated raster bars, scrolling text, and synthwave-inspired sound cues to celebrate the demoscene heritage while remaining fully interactive in the browser.

## Controls
- **Start Demo**: Launches the animation loop and begins playback of the accompanying chiptune soundtrack.
- **Stop Demo**: Pauses the animation and fades out the audio.
- **Toggle Scanlines**: Adds or removes CRT-style scanlines overlay for a more retro aesthetic.

## Media Attribution

- **Visuals**: All animations are procedurally generated within the applet scripts.
