# Bang Bang Beat Barrage

Bang Bang Beat Barrage is a percussion duel where you slam twin rhythm cannons in time with a reactive beat rail. Watch for the glowing cue, strike the matching pad (left or right) with clicks or the **A** and **L** keys, and keep the crowd voltage soaring. Chain flawless hits to unlock a Thunder Slam that wipes the loop and rockets your score.

## Controls
- **A / Left Bang** — Fire the left cannon when the active beat wants a red spark.
- **L / Right Bang** — Fire the right cannon when the active beat wants a gold spark.
- **Space / Thunder Slam button** — When your combo reaches 8, trigger a slam to reset the pattern with a huge voltage surge.

## Goals
- Maintain accuracy to raise the crowd’s energy bar.
- Stack long combos to speed up the tempo and earn more points.
- Deploy Thunder Slams at peak voltage to stay ahead of the barrage.

The experience is fully self-contained and doesn’t call any remote APIs.
