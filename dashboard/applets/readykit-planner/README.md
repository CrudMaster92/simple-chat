ReadyKit Planner helps households tailor emergency go-bags to the exact people, pets, climate, and hazards they care about. Adjust headcount and time horizon, toggle hazard scenarios, and the kit blueprint recalibrates quantities instantly.

## Highlights

- **Hazard-driven add-ons** – pick from earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wildfires, pandemics, and more to surface the right specialty gear.
- **Readiness timeline** – maintenance rituals stay visible with checkable cadence buckets for this week, monthly, and seasonal reviews.
