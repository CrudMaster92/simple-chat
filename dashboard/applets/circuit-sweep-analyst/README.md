# Circuit Sweep Analyst

Circuit Sweep Analyst reimagines the classic Windows Minesweeper as a circuit-audit command deck. Dial in your grid, deploy a scan, and trace risk signatures with live heatmaps, auto flag assist, and a pulse hint engine that spots the calmest tiles. Build safe streaks to amplify your momentum multiplier while keeping unstable sparks in check.

## Features
- **Difficulty kits** for Intro, Analyst, and Architect grids with adjustable spark density.
- **Auto heatmap overlays** that visualize low / medium / high risk exposure when toggled or on reveal.
- **Momentum meter** that rewards streaks of safe reveals with a multiplier.
- **Flag assist** that marks fully deduced sparks to keep your focus on analysis.
- **Pulse hint** that identifies the safest tile candidate based on surrounding telemetry.

Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScriptâ€”no frameworks required.
