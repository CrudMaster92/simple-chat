# Nebula Gear Emulator

Nebula Gear Emulator recreates a prototype handheld console stocked with experimental
"cartridges" from a fictional studio. The virtual device powers up inside a
retro-futuristic shell, letting players swap between micro games that lean into
quick reflexes and grid-based pattern control.

## Included Cartridges
- **Orbit Hop Prototype** – Pilot a drifting capsule, sweep up luminous drift
  seeds, and stretch a combo timer while staying inside the vacuum dome.
- **Glitch Garden Debugger** – Patrol a shimmering circuit garden, quash
  runaway glitches, and keep stability above zero before the wave counter
  overloads.

Each module runs entirely in-browser with HTML canvas rendering and keyboard
controls. A power switch, reset toggle, and cartridge library menu make the
experience feel like tinkering with a dev kit emulator from a parallel arcade
future.
