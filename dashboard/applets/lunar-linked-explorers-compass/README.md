# Lunar-Linked Explorer's Compass

A calming navigational ritual where lunar phases, drifting bearings, and shifting motifs respond to your curiosity. Adjust the sliders to retune the compass glow, choose a motif to change the story, or let the wander button set a new course. Each captured moment is stored as a whisper in the explorer's field notes.
