# Prism Pulse Labyrinth

Prism Pulse Labyrinth is a cosmic pattern-chasing memory game. Watch the radiant tiles flash, then recreate the sequence without exhausting your stability. Each cleared wave adds a new step to the labyrinthine signal. Keep your streak alive to earn amplified resonance callouts.

## How to Play

1. Press **Start Pulse** to begin.
2. Observe the flashing order of the four tiles.
3. Click the tiles in the same order once the sequence ends.
4. Clear waves to lengthen the pattern. Mistakes drain stabilityâ€”lose all three pips and the signal collapses.

Replay the wave after each misfire and see how far your memory can travel.
