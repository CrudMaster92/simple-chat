# Aetherwave Convergence Lab

Aetherwave Convergence Lab is an ambitious expedition console that fuses kinetic
diagrams, speculative telemetry, and an evolving blueprint chronicle. Tune
energy sequences, sculpt resonance depth, and weave pulse motifs to conjure a
living convergence simulation. Archive your favourite mixes, export manifests,
and let the Auto Cycle keeper drift through harmonics hands-free.

## Features

- **Phase Controls** — Select bespoke energy sequences, tune resonance depth,
  and toggle pulse motifs with tactile chips. Shuffle parameters or let the
  Auto Cycle steward glide through every configuration.
- **Convergence Stage** — A live canvas renders orbiting particle fields and
  animated trace beams that respond instantly to your inputs, while telemetry
  readouts surface narrative-rich status updates.
- **Blueprint Chronicle** — Capture imprints of your favourite mixes, replay
  them on demand, or focus a blueprint to review its manifest-ready payload.
  Export the entire chronicle as structured JSON when you're ready to share.

## Running the Applet

Serve the repository root (for example with `python -m http.server`) and open
`http://localhost:8000/`. Launch the dashboard tile for **Aetherwave
Convergence Lab** to explore the full experience.
