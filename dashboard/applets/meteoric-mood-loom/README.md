# Meteoric Mood Loom

Meteoric Mood Loom lets you braid cosmic listening sessions by pairing meteor streams with moods, tempos, and instruments. Each
sequence renders a bespoke constellation sketch and logs the session into an observatory journal.

## Features
- Pick from four meteor showers, each with a unique glyph signature.
- Sculpt the drift tempo with live descriptors ranging from Still hush to Meteor rush.
- Toggle emotive mood threads and up to three instrument layers to color the arrangement.
- Generate deterministic constellation patterns and a narrative entry for every weave.
- Maintain an observatory journal with timestamped entries and quick clearing.

## Controls
- **Random Starfall**: shuffle every parameter and immediately weave a new pattern.
- **Weave Sequence**: synthesize a constellation from the current selections.
- **Clear log**: wipe the observatory journal while keeping your current settings intact.

The close button in the top-right corner returns you to the dashboard when you're ready to explore other experiences.
