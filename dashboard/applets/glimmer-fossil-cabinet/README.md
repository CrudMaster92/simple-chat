# Glimmer Fossil Cabinet

Glimmer Fossil Cabinet is an immersive cabinet-building experience for noctilucent relics. Players pull enigmatic specimens from
the archive, place them on rotating stands, and tune their glow to compose a personalized fossil tableau.

## Features
- **Specimen Archive:** Browse five bioluminescent fossils, each with whispered field notes and origin hints.
- **Interactive Stands:** Drop fossils into any of the five cabinet stands, rotate them on the yaw axis, and dial their
  radiance to craft new silhouettes.
- **Lore Plaques:** Every fossil unlocks evocative plaques that nudge—but never fully reveal—their forgotten histories.
- **Status Guidance:** Real-time prompts help players know when stands are empty, occupied, or ready for adjustments.
