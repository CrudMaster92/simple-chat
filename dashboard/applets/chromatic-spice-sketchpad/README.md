# Chromatic Spice Sketchpad

Chromatic Spice Sketchpad is a synesthetic play space where color, flavor, and sound intertwine. Drag fragrant spices and mineral pigments onto the bloom field to layer palettes, then listen as gentle tones acknowledge each new harmony. The interface invites calm experimentation with soft gradients, draggable vials, and encouraging copy.

## Features
- **Drag-and-drop palette making** – Drop spices and pigments onto the bloom field to sprout animated fragments that describe your blend.
- **Synesthetic whispers** – Each fragment generates a poetic tasting note paired with a soft oscillator tone in a complementary register.
- **Click or keyboard friendly** – Pantry vials can be triggered via click or keyboard activation, and the bloom can be reset with a single tap.

## How to run
Open `index.html` in a modern browser. Drag pantry vials into the bloom field or select them with keyboard focus and press `Enter` or `Space` to hear the harmonic cues. Use the **Clear Bloom** button to start fresh.
