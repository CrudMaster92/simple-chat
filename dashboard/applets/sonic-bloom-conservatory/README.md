# Sonic Bloom Conservatory

Sonic Bloom Conservatory is a luminous audio garden where each fantastical bloom sings a looping tone that gently evolves over time. Blend the blooms together, sculpt the shimmer trail, and invite soft breezes to generate your own atmospheric composition.

## Features
- Five unique flora voices built with the Web Audio API.
- Dynamic modulation for each bloom that slowly drifts in pitch and filter color.
- Environmental controls for echo shimmer, canopy shade (global tone), and wind noise.
- Accessible, mobile-friendly UI with poetic descriptions to inspire creative listening.

## Usage
1. Click **Enter the Conservatory** to unlock audio playback.
2. Toggle blooms on and off to combine their voices. Adjust each bloom's glow intensity to balance the mix.
3. Shape the ambiance using the shimmer trail, glide breeze, and canopy shade sliders.
4. Craft layered sonic blooms and lose yourself in the evolving soundscape.
