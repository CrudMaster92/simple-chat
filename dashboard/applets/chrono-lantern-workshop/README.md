# Chrono Lantern Workshop

Chrono Lantern Workshop invites caretakers to weave luminescent lanterns that evolve with time-of-day, seasonal dyes, and weather-driven chimes. Adjust the daylight arc slider or jump to quick presets to feel the glow flow from dawn to midnight. Select a season and sky resonance to watch fiber opacity, aura halos, and chime palettes morph in response.

## Features
- **Time-reactive light core** – slider-controlled daylight arc adjusts brightness, hue, and aura dynamics.
- **Seasonal fiber looms** – each season introduces unique strand colors, opacity ranges, and narrative descriptions.
- **Weather-linked chimes** – choose clear, mist, or storm resonance to retune gradient chimes and glow intensity.
- **Live narration** – text panels chronicle the lantern's light, chime, and fiber states as settings shift.
