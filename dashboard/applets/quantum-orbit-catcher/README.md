# Quantum Orbit Catcher

Quantum Orbit Catcher is a fast-paced reflex game where you pilot a shuttle between three glowing lanes to snare luminous particles before they destabilize the fusion core. Each successful catch speeds up the stream, and three misses will overload the reactor.

## How to Play
- Press **Ignite Reactor** (or tap space) to begin a run.
- Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** to slide the interceptor shuttle between lanes.
- Catch incoming particles to score flux points and maintain stability.
- Missing three particles ends the runâ€”chase a new personal best stored in local memory.

## Accessibility Notes
- The playfield is labelled as an application region with concise telemetry feedback.
- Score and stability readouts update live for screen readers.
- Controls rely on keyboard arrows, with optional spacebar start.
